## Abstract
<br>A core security challenge for the Internet of Things is to devise re-
liable and energy-efficient authentication techniques. Radio finger-
printing addresses this problem by leveraging the unique hardware-
level imperfections imposed on the received wireless signal by
the transmitter’s radio circuitry, thus avoiding energy-expensive
cryptography at the transmitter’s side. Most of existing approaches
utilize hand-tailored protocol-specific feature extraction techniques,
which can identify devices operating under a pre-defined wireless
protocol only and are thus not amenable to fingerprint the multi-
tude of wireless devices currently available in the IoT. Conversely,
by mapping inputs onto a very large feature space, deep learning
algorithms can be trained to fingerprint large populations of devices
operating under any wireless standard. 
<br>One of the most crucial challenges in radio fingerprinting is
to counteract the action of the wireless channel, which decreases
fingerprinting accuracy significantly by disrupting hardware im-
pairments. On the other hand, due to their sheer size, deep learning
algorithms are hardly re-trainable in real-time. Another aspect that
is yet to be investigated is whether an adversary can successfully
impersonate another device’s fingerprint. To address these key is-
sues, this paper proposes DeepRadioID, a system to optimize the
accuracy of deep-learning-based radio fingerprinting algorithms
without retraining the underlying deep learning model. The key intu-
ition is that through the application of a carefully-optimized digital
finite input response filter (FIR) at the transmitter’s side, we can ap-
ply tiny modifications to the waveform to strengthen its fingerprint according to the current channel conditions. We mathematically
formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP) as the prob-
lem of finding, for a given trained neural network, the optimum FIR
to be used by the transmitter to improve its current fingerprinting
accuracy. Moreover, since the FIR is tailored to the specific device’s
hardware imperfections, we show that an adversary will not be
able to use the FIR to imitate a legitimate device’s fingerprint.
<br>We extensively evaluate DeepRadioID on a experimental testbed
of 20 nominally-identical software-defined radios, as well as on two
datasets made up by 500 ADS-B devices and by 500 WiFi devices
provided by the DARPA RFMLS program. Experimental results
show that DeepRadioID (i) increases fingerprinting accuracy by
about 35%, 50% and 58% on the three scenarios considered; (ii)
decreases an adversary’s accuracy by about 54% when trying to
imitate other device’s fingerprints by using their filters; (iii) achieves
27% improvement over the state of the art on a 100-device dataset.
